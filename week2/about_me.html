    <p>
        I recently took a getaway trip to New York to visit my friends for New Years!
        This was a special trip because I was able to see NY for the first time while
        visting my buddy who I haven't seen in a couple of years all at time. The 
        food scene there is insane!
    </p>
    <p>
        So you want to know my 3 favorite pet names huh?
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive</li>
        <li>Ben</li>
        <li>Obi</li>
    </ul>
    <p> 
        What is my favorite restaurant you ask: <a href="https://phopasteurboston.net/" target="_blank">phopasteurboston</a>
    </p>
    <div class="food-container">
        <img src="images/pho.jpg" alt="My Favorite Food" class="food-image">
        <div>
            <p>
                One can never go wrong with pho. Especially in the winter time. Personally
                I think what makes pho so great is the broth. If you get the broth right,
                then I consider you a great pho spot. Anyone can get the noodles right but getting
                the broth right is HARD!
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="clearfix"></div>
    <p>
        And lastly, you want my favorite books:
